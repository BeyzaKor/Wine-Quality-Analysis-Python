## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive statistical and machine learning analysis of red and white wine datasets. The objective was to investigate the chemical properties of wine in relation to quality, using a range of analytical techniques.

---

## 🧠 Key Methods Applied

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**T-tests** comparing red vs. white wine indicators
**Multiple Linear Regression** (with feature selection using AIC)
**Random Forest Regression** with variable importance analysis
**K-Means Clustering** (with silhouette scores and cluster comparison)
**DBSCAN Clustering** for density-based exploration

---

## 📊 Highlights

**Red vs. White Wine Comparison**  
Statistical testing showed significant differences in nearly all chemical indicators.

**Wine Quality Prediction**  
Regression and Random Forest models were used to predict wine quality.  
- R² (Linear Regression): ~0.30  
- R² (Random Forest): ~0.45

**Clustering**  
K-Means identified two major wine clusters with distinct characteristics.  
DBSCAN was tested as an alternative but performed less effectively.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy

## 📎 Notes

This project was developed for academic coursework and portfolio demonstration.  
All code and visualizations were written by me as part of a final MSc assignment.
